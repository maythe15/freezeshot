# freezeshot

Simple Linux Mint screenshot tool designed to replace the built in *Copy a screenshot of an area to clipboard* keyboard shortcut. The advantage and main goal of this tool is that it freezes the screen during region selection and screenshotting.

Support for multiple monitors is experimental.
